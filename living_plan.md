## 🎯 Main Objective
Build, validate, and expand a strictly typed, headless, deterministic text-adventure engine. Use an autonomous playtest loop to ensure absolute replayability, solve soft-locks, and improve game feel without human intervention.

## ⚡ Active Task for Next Cycle
**Task ID**: `AF-18`
* **Objective**: Design and implement a dynamic priority queue for network packet routing that prioritizes gossip state updates over heartbeats, optimizing overall state convergence speed.
* **Why this matters**: In highly congested mesh network scenarios, state updates are crucial for consistency and should take precedence over diagnostic heartbeats to prevent state lag.
* **Planned Actions**:
  1. Add routing priority fields to `RoutedPacket` and implement priority-based packet queue sorting in `MeshNetwork`.
  2. Benchmark and assert state convergence speed under high packet queue depth.
  3. Add robust unit tests to verify priority routing behaviors.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **State-space explosion during pathfinding** | High | Cap the maximum depth/steps of the state explorer and focus validation on critical gate variables and room reachability. Exclude `DROP` actions to keep puzzle path traversal clean. |
| **Timeout during playtest** | High | Keep playtest path lengths bounded (e.g. max 35 steps) and use efficient execution loops. |
| **Nondeterminism in engine** | High | Standardized JSON serialization sorting keys before hashing. Property test action sequences to assert identical hashes. |
| **Infinite debugging loops** | Medium | Limit autonomous cycle runs to a single task per CLI session, preventing internal loops. |
