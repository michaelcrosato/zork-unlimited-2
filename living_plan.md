## 🎯 Main Objective
Build, validate, and expand a strictly typed, headless, deterministic text-adventure engine. Use an autonomous playtest loop to ensure absolute replayability, solve soft-locks, and improve game feel without human intervention.

## 📊 Backlog & Roadmap

### Phase 1: Stability & Validation (Completed)
- [x] Establish deterministic state step transitions and mulberry32 PRNG.
- [x] Implement SHA-256 state hashing for perfect replayability.
- [x] Create Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (CYOA) schemas and validators.
- [x] Create Zork-style Parser schemas and validators.
- [x] Audit and resolve warnings in existing content packs.
- [x] Add rigorous unit tests for deep edge cases in effect/condition DSL.

### Phase 2: Game Feel & Mechanics Expansion (Completed)
- [x] Introduce "Sierra-Quest-style" score telemetry and puzzle trackers.
- [x] Add advanced NPC dialogue trees and multi-option dynamic choice routing.
- [x] Implement a full graph-based pathfinder validator to check for hard soft-locks (detect unreachable win states).

### Phase 3: Headless Playtest Automation & Procedural Dungeons (Completed)
- [x] Implement the `ai-autopilot.ts` run harness using deterministic mock LLMs.
- [x] Support real LLM execution using environment variables (Gemini / OpenAI).
- [x] Connect the output of playtests directly to automatic code tests.
- [x] Design, implement, and validate advanced playtest personas (hoarder, explorer, dropper) to discover complex multi-step game design bugs.
- [x] Introduce and validate Stage 2 procedural rooms and dynamic template generators (`AF-08`).

### Phase 4: Weather Systems & Environmental Effects (Completed)
- [x] Add environmental weather/temperature state fields to the GameState Schema (`AF-09`).
- [x] Build stateless pure-hash deterministic weather ticking every 5 steps.
- [x] Support `weather_is` and `temperature_is` condition modifiers in the DSL.
- [x] Inject dynamic scenic atmospheric narration based on weather for outdoor locations.
- [x] Write comprehensive Vitest test coverage and pass all autopilot playtests.

### Phase 5: Environmental Restraints & Pathfinder Optimization (Completed)
- [x] Add detailed architectural comments to `tickEnvironment` and `getWeatherForStep` explaining stateless pure-hash math (`AF-10`).
- [x] Implement an optional `weather_pool` property in rooms/scenes and templates to restrict local room climate.
- [x] Force immediate deterministic weather updates upon room entry when current weather is invalid for the new pool.
- [x] Optimize pathfinder to omit environment fields from state keys unless weather conditions are defined in the pack.
- [x] Add robust unit tests for climate restriction transitions and pathfinder key optimizations.

### Phase 6: Multi-Agent Synchronization & Telemetry (Completed)
- [x] Add a transaction journal to capture and serialize multi-agent interactions (`AF-11`).
- [x] Implement an optimistic lock mechanism and sequence number/hash validation for state sync (`AF-11`).
- [x] Expand content packs to include cooperative multi-agent scenarios (`multiplayer_forest.yaml`).
- [x] Write comprehensive Vitest tests verifying registration, synchronization, locking, and telemetry (`AF-11`).

### Phase 7: State Rollback & Conflict Resolution (Completed)
- [x] Design a state-rollback and re-apply mechanism that merges non-conflicting concurrent actions (`AF-12`).
- [x] Build a local buffer for agent actions (`AgentActionBuffer`) that handles laggy transport simulations (`AF-12`).
- [x] Expand unit test suites to simulate concurrent agent racing conditions (`AF-12`).

### Phase 8: Gossip Protocol & Delta-State Sync (Completed)
- [x] Build a light peer sync representation using Vector Clocks (`AF-13`).
- [x] Implement state reconciliation using commutative delta-state merges and deterministic transaction replay (`AF-13`).
- [x] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests simulating network partitions and convergence upon recovery (`AF-13`).

### Phase 9: Decentralized Cooperative Dungeons (Completed)
- [x] Build a decentralized procedural room synchronizer propagating rooms via GossipNode transactions (`AF-14`).
- [x] Implement lock-free chest loot claiming using LWW CRDT transaction merges (`AF-14`).
- [x] Write comprehensive unit and integration tests simulating explorations, partitions, and races (`AF-14`).

### Phase 10: Local Network Discovery & Mesh Routing (Completed)
- [x] Design a decentralized `NetworkDiscovery` registry that simulates dynamic P2P node joining/leaving (`AF-15`).
- [x] Support automatic route calculation and multi-hop gossip forwarding through intermediary peers (`AF-15`).
- [x] Add rigorous test cases for mesh discovery, packet routing, and message forwarding convergence (`AF-15`).

## ⚡ Active Task for Next Cycle
**Task ID**: `AF-16`
* **Objective**: Build a persistent Peer Discovery Narration & Cooperative Sync Event log in the Zork-style Parser engine, allowing players to see atmospheric announcements when peers dynamically join/leave, or when distant peers synchronize state.
* **Why this matters**: Keeps players immersed in a multiplayer text adventure by providing narrative representation of P2P network events (peer joining/leaving/state sync) rather than just headless engine mutations.
* **Planned Actions**:
  1. Add support for triggering `NarrationEvent` or similar custom sensory announcements in the text-adventure narrative when P2P peer events (join/leave/sync) occur.
  2. Implement customizable network narrative templates in the content pack schema to describe peer arrival and departure atmospherically.
  3. Expand the Vitest suite to verify that network discovery events trigger correct, immersive narration descriptions to players.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **State-space explosion during pathfinding** | High | Cap the maximum depth/steps of the state explorer and focus validation on critical gate variables and room reachability. Exclude `DROP` actions to keep puzzle path traversal clean. |
| **Timeout during playtest** | High | Keep playtest path lengths bounded (e.g. max 35 steps) and use efficient execution loops. |
| **Nondeterminism in engine** | High | Standardized JSON serialization sorting keys before hashing. Property test action sequences to assert identical hashes. |
| **Infinite debugging loops** | Medium | Limit autonomous cycle runs to a single task per CLI session, preventing internal loops. |
